# Python_scripting

I learnt the basics of python scripting and went down on a few python topics such as: Python Data types, modules, error handling, how to read and write to a file,
working with json and csv files, conditionals, loops, python operators, functions, comparisms, variables, etc.
These files are rich in examples that can help anyone who is getting started with Python scripting understand the concepts discussed in this repo.

Some of the contents of this repo are a few python projects I can attempt on my own always.
